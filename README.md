# Fin Sanctuary

Fin Sanctuary is a content and recommendation website for people in the United States who want an aquarium for their home or small office. The site is not intended for commercial aquarium installations. Its two core pillars are:

- An aquarium setup wizard that helps visitors choose the right tank, fish, equipment, and accessories based on their needs
- A large knowledge library covering aquarium topics such as fish types, diseases, food, filtration, substrate, lighting, and maintenance

Primary production domain:

- `https://finsanctuary.com`

The business model includes:

- Google AdSense placements
- Affiliate links inside guides and recommendation flows
- Direct sales of 3D-printed aquarium accessories
- Newsletter signup for repeat traffic and promotions

## Current Scope

- Gallery, About, and Contact pages
- Mobile navigation, light/dark mode support, and a shared editorial-style design system
- Public-facing placeholder/future-language cleanup has been applied across the site to improve AdSense readiness and overall trust

## Product Direction

The long-term site structure is:

- `Wizard`: recommendation flow for tank size, fish style, equipment, accessories, and beginner fit

- `Shop`: 3D-printed aquarium accessories made by the site owner, with Etsy as the public ordering path
- `Gallery`: real tanks, accessories, and customer submissions
- `Videos`: tile-based YouTube library with direct outbound links
- `Podcasts`: low-emphasis holding page kept out of search until real episodes exist
- `Newsletter`: aquarium tips, new products, and affiliate/promotional content
- `About` and `Contact`: trust-building pages for the brand

## Audience

- Home aquarium beginners
- Small-office aquarium buyers
- Hobbyists researching upgrades, equipment, fish compatibility, and maintenance

## Brand Notes

Current project palette:

- `#0185AE`
- `#0DAFBC`
- `#8AC9AB`
- `#F3EFEE`
- `#E8D9BF`

Note: the original brief included `#F3WFEE`, which is not a valid hex code. This repo currently uses `#F3EFEE`.

## Stack

- Astro 6
- Tailwind CSS 4 via `@tailwindcss/vite`
- Static site output
- Astro content collections for guides

## Requirements

- Node `22.12.0+` or `24.x`
- npm `11+`

This repo intentionally blocks unsupported Node versions such as Node 25 because the current Astro toolchain can fail there with misleading build errors.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Start the dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Create a production build:

```sh
npm run build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```sh
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

For Cloudflare Pages, use:

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Build output directory: `dist`
- Node.js version: `22.12.0` or another supported `22.12+` / `24.x` release
- Root directory: repo root
- Optional environment variable for the homepage ad block: `PUBLIC_ADSENSE_HOME_INLINE_SLOT=<your ad slot id>`
- Optional environment variable for the guides hub ad block: `PUBLIC_ADSENSE_GUIDES_HUB_SLOT=<your ad slot id>`
- Optional environment variable for guide-page inline ads: `PUBLIC_ADSENSE_GUIDE_INLINE_SLOT=<your ad slot id>`
- Optional environment variable for the wizard-page ad block: `PUBLIC_ADSENSE_WIZARD_INLINE_SLOT=<your ad slot id>`
- Optional environment variable for GA4 event collection: `PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=<your GA4 measurement id>`
- Optional environment variable for a future newsletter provider endpoint: `PUBLIC_NEWSLETTER_ACTION=<your form action url>`
- `public/ads.txt` is committed and should deploy to `https://finsanctuary.com/ads.txt`

The Astro site URL is configured as `https://finsanctuary.com` in `astro.config.mjs`, so canonical URLs and site-level metadata resolve against the production domain.

## Contact Channels

The live site currently uses these contact addresses:

- `drodge00@finsanctuary.com` for direct personal contact with Dave
- `info@finsanctuary.com` for general questions and business inquiries
- `support@finsanctuary.com` for product help and troubleshooting
- `newsletter@finsanctuary.com` for newsletter-related communication

These addresses are surfaced on the About and Contact pages so visitors can choose the right inbox instead of relying only on the generic contact form.

## Trust and Compliance

The live site now includes public trust/compliance pages for:

- `Privacy Policy`
- `Terms of Use`
- `Affiliate Disclosure`
- `Advertising Disclosure`

These pages are linked in the footer and surfaced where commercial context matters, including guides, shop, and contact flows. They are intended to improve visitor trust and support transparent AdSense and affiliate use.

## Guide Format Standard

All current and future long-form guides should follow the same presentation pattern:

- long-form editorial article structure
- dynamic route rendering through `src/pages/guides/[slug].astro`
- frontmatter-driven content in `src/content/guides/*.md`
- optional hero artwork stored under `public/images/guides/`
- rounded-corner hero image presentation
- standard square guide-image rendering at `494 x 494 px` when square artwork is used
- per-guide hero controls through frontmatter when needed

Current supported guide frontmatter fields include:

- `heroImage`
- `heroImageAlt`
- `heroImageFit`
- `heroImageAspect`
- `heroLayout`
- `heroTitleSize`

These settings exist so a guide can keep the same overall template while adjusting image fit, image proportions, and header balance for specific artwork. The default expectation is that new guides should use the established guide layout first, then only use per-guide overrides when the artwork or title treatment genuinely requires it.

## Media Architecture

The site now supports dedicated media sections beyond the gallery:

- `src/content/videos/*.md` holds individual video entries
- `src/pages/videos.astro` is the videos hub and now renders videos as tiles with thumbnails, titles, descriptions, and direct YouTube links
- `src/pages/podcasts.astro` is a low-emphasis podcast holding page that stays out of search until real episodes are published

The gallery can still feature media, but videos no longer need to live only as gallery embeds. The current site model uses a simple video-library page rather than separate on-site video detail URLs.

## UX Direction

Recent site-improvement work focused on:

- clearer first-click homepage flow
- stronger beginner onboarding for first-time visitors
- stronger trust signaling for AdSense and affiliate readiness
- less “placeholder” framing on production pages
- removal of visible ad-setup fallbacks and “coming soon” style messaging on key public pages
- better guide discovery with search and beginner entry points
- stronger conversion paths from guides, shop, and wizard results into email signup and next actions

## Newsletter and Conversion Flow

The site currently uses a shared newsletter action and shared conversion patterns instead of disconnected placeholder boxes.

Current conversion surfaces include:

- dedicated `/newsletter` landing page
- dedicated `/newsletter-confirmation` page after signup
- homepage email signup for guide and product updates
- contact-page email signup plus direct inbox routing
- shared newsletter signup card on guide pages
- built-in social sharing on guide pages for passive growth and long-form content distribution
- shared newsletter signup card on the shop page
- shared newsletter signup card on videos, podcasts, and gallery pages
- wizard result CTA block pointing visitors to guides, shop, and email signup
- tracked CTA and conversion surfaces across the homepage, guides, contact, shop, and wizard

The shop page now uses the live Pixels and Chisels Etsy storefront as its public ordering path. Visitors can browse the accessory lineup, click through to Etsy, ask about custom prints or fit, and join the list for new product drops.

This keeps the major decision pages focused on a clearer next action instead of dropping visitors into dead ends.

The newsletter system is now centralized in the repo:

- one shared signup component
- one shared newsletter action config in `src/data/newsletter.ts`
- source tagging preserved across all signup locations
- a dedicated signup page and confirmation page for cleaner UX

The current analytics/event layer is intentionally lightweight:

- GA4 can be enabled with `PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`
- events safely push through `window.dataLayer` even before GA4 is configured
- current tracked actions include newsletter submits, contact form submits, major CTA clicks, shop-interest clicks, email-link clicks, guide navigation/related/share clicks, wizard completion events, media outbound clicks, and Start Here/onboarding choices
- event definitions and recommended first reports are documented in `docs/analytics-events.md`

## SEO and Metadata

The site now includes a stronger metadata baseline for search engines and link previews:

- canonical URLs generated from `https://finsanctuary.com`
- richer Open Graph and Twitter card metadata through the shared layout
- dedicated OG preview images for the main non-guide page types
- Organization and WebSite JSON-LD on the shared layout
- Article JSON-LD plus article metadata on guide pages
- `public/robots.txt`
- generated sitemap route at `/sitemap.xml`

This phase improves how the site presents in search results, crawlers, and social sharing without changing the editorial page structure.

## Current Gaps

- Several planned guides still need to be built and published, even though unfinished topics are no longer exposed as placeholder cards on the guides hub
- The shop now has the live Etsy storefront path, but it still needs a fuller set of real product listings, real product media, and tighter guide-to-product matching
- Affiliate links and gallery media still need real assets and live destinations
- AdSense loader and inline ad blocks are wired, but real ad delivery still requires live slot IDs in deployment environment variables
- Newsletter tooling still needs deeper integration beyond the current Formspree-based signup capture
- Analytics now has a baseline event layer, but it still needs a real reporting/dashboard workflow and broader outbound-click instrumentation
- Social preview artwork now covers the core page types, but it can still be improved further with more custom guide-level preview assets and richer media-specific variants
- Some guide pages now support hero artwork, but most guides still need final branded images
